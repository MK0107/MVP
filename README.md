  Mellow is a task tracker that can help its users easily manage tickets and daily todo's by category and urgency.
  With easy UI/UX, users are allowed to collect statistical analysis of the tickets with personalized configuration.

## Installation

  Use the package manager 'npm' to install dependencies and run scripts to start server and webpack.

npm install
npm run express-dev
npm run react-dev
```

## Usage

  Mellow was created to help and optimize management of perosnal or business tasks for any occasion.
  We are talking about as minute as watering plants every other week to critical business meetings.
  
  After logging into the application, users can create a board/room with names they like to give, and in that room they can create tickets.
  These tickets can be specifically categorized for description (debugging/task/chore/general) and urgency (chill/important/important/critical).
  The admin/creator of the room can add or invite another members and has accessability to set terms to display analytical graphs to monitor the status of all tickets.
