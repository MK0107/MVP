# Mellow

  Mellow is a task tracker that can help its users to easily manage tickets and daily to-do's by category and urgency.
  It also allows pull down of statistical analysis of the cycle upon the user configuration.

## Installation

  Use the package manager 'npm' to install dependencies and run scripts to start server and webpack.

```bash
npm install
npm run express-dev
npm run react-dev
```

## Usage

  Mellow was created to help and optimize management of perosnal or business tasks for any occasion.
  We are talking about as minute as watering plants every other week to critical business meetings.
  
  After logging into the application, users can create a board/room with names they like to give, and in that room they can create tickets.
  These tickets can be specifically categorized for description (debugging/task/chore/general) and urgency (chill/important/important/critical).
  The admin/creator of the room can add or invite another members and has accessability to set terms to display analytical graphs to monitor the status of all tickets.
